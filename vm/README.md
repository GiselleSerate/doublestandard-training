Download VirtualBox from:
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

Download the 32-bit (not 64-bit!!) Kali VirtualBox image from: 
https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/

When you have done both of these, double click the VirtualBox image (the second thing you downloaded). This should start up the VirtualBox console with a Kali VM listed. Double click the VM in the list and allow it to import. If after this it doesn't want to start up, go into settings for that machine (right click it in the list), go to USB, and uncheck Enable USB. (If you find later that you do need to connect a USB device to your VM, we can revisit this setting, but for now we shouldn't need it.)
